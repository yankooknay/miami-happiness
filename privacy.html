                    providing certain information to one or more of our service providers which verify your identity. If
                    you commence the registration process, you do so with the understanding that your personal data will
                    be transferred to a service provider and processed subject to their distinct privacy policy and
                    terms and conditions. Service Providers likely require that you submit your passport or other
                    government identification document, and use facial analysis software to verify your identity.</p>

                    number, credit card expiration date, and security code, which they process and store subject to
                    their privacy policy and terms of service. We do not receive your full credit card number, credit
                    card expiration date, or the security code. Instead, the payment provider provides us with a “token”
                    that represents your account, your card’s expiration date, card type and the first two and last four
                    digits of your card number. If you are required to provide your name and email address to the
                    payment provider, then they also provide us with that information. Payments issued to Creators for
                    their content are made by MIAMISTUDIO using the bank account information that we have collected and
