                    America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent

                <p>Please review the MIAMISTUDIO Rules and Policies, which are part of the User Agreement and outline what is
                    prohibited on the Services. You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and all
                    applicable laws, rules and regulations.</p><br />
                <p>Our Services evolve constantly. As such, the Services may change from time to time, at our
                    discretion. We may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services or any features within
                    the Services to you or to users generally. We also retain the right to create limits on use and
                    storage at our sole discretion at any time. We may also remove or refuse to distribute any Content

                    agree not to misuse our Services, for example, by interfering with them or accessing them using a
                    method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You agree that you will not
                    work around any technical limitations in the software provided to you as part of the Services, or
                    reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that
                    applicable law expressly permits. You may not do any of the following while accessing or using the
                    Services: (i) access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Services, MIAMISTUDIO’s computer
                    systems, or the technical delivery systems of MIAMISTUDIO’s providers; (ii) probe, scan, or test the
                    vulnerability of any system or network or breach or circumvent any security or authentication
                    measures; (iii) access or search or attempt to access or search the Services by any means (automated

                    MIAMISTUDIO (and only pursuant to the applicable terms and conditions), unless you have been specifically
                    allowed to do so in a separate agreement with MIAMISTUDIO (NOTE: crawling the Services is permissible if
                    done in accordance with the provisions of the robots.txt file, however, scraping the Services
                    without the prior consent of MIAMISTUDIO is expressly prohibited); (iv) forge any TCP/IP packet header or
                    any part of the header information in any email or posting, or in any way use the Services to send
                    altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information; or (v) interfere with, or disrupt, (or
                    attempt to do so), the access of any user, host or network, including, without limitation, sending a
                    virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Services, or by scripting the creation of
                    Content in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the Services. We also
                    reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe
                    is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request,
                    (ii) enforce the Terms, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect,
                    prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support
                    requests, or (v) protect the rights, property or safety of MIAMISTUDIO, its users and the public. MIAMISTUDIO
                    does not disclose personally-identifying information to third parties except in accordance with our

                <p>MIAMISTUDIO may offer certain services or features for which additional terms and conditions may apply in

                    you agree to any additional terms applicable to those services, and those additional terms become
                    part of our agreement with you. If any of the applicable additional terms conflict with these Terms,
                    the additional terms will prevail while you are using those services to which they apply.</p><br />
                <p class="text-[18px] font-bold">Your Account </p><br />
                <p>You may need to create an account to use some of our Services. You are responsible for safeguarding
                    your account, so use a strong password and limit its use to this account. We cannot and will not be
                    liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above.</p><br />
                <p>You can control most communications from the Services. We may need to provide you with certain
                    communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are
                    considered part of the Services and your account, and you may not be able to opt-out from receiving
                    them. If you added your phone number to your account and you later change or deactivate that phone
                    number, you must update your account information to help prevent us from communicating with anyone
                    who acquires your old number.</p><br />

                <p>We may suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at
                    any time for any or no reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have
                    violated these Terms or the MIAMISTUDIO Rules and Policies (ii) you create risk or possible legal
                    exposure for us; (iii) your account should be removed due to unlawful conduct, (iv) your account
                    should be removed due to prolonged inactivity; or (v) our provision of the Services to you is no
                    longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address
                    associated with your account or the next time you attempt to access your account, depending on the
                    circumstances. In all such cases, the Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your
                    license to use the Services, except that the following sections shall continue to apply: 2, 3, 5,
                    and 6. If you believe your account was terminated in error you can file an appeal following the
                    steps found in our Help Center. For the avoidance of doubt, these Terms survive the deactivation or
                    termination of your account.</p><br />

                <p>We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be retroactive, and the most
                    current version of the Terms, which will always be at MIAMISTUDIO.com/tos, will govern our relationship
                    with you. Other than for changes addressing new functions or made for legal reasons, we will notify
                    you 30 days in advance of making effective changes to these Terms that impact the rights or
                    obligations of any party to these Terms, for example via a service notification or an email to the
                    email associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those
                    revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p><br />

                    provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. MIAMISTUDIO’s failure to enforce any
                    right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.</p><br />
